This was an exercise in creating nested forms in Ruby on Rails. It is supposed to mimic the functionality of Google Plus, where a user has a circle made of many different users. A user can share a post with many different circles, and different circles can comment on those posts.

There is also a password authentication section, where a user will recieve an email if they don't remember their original password. This was done using Action Mailer, and our own custom methods.
